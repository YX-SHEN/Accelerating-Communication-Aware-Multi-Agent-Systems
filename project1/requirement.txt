Treat next line as plain text input and translate it into English Language, output translation ONLY. If translation is unnecessary (e.g. proper nouns, codes, etc.), return the original text. NO explanations. NO notes. Input:
```txt
# requirements.txt

# —— Core ——
numpy>=1.22,<3.0
pandas>=1.5,<3.0
matplotlib>=3.7,<3.10
scipy>=1.10,<2.0

Script/Monitor
psutil>=5.9
pynvml>=11.0

# —— GPU Backend (either one or both can be installed) ——
# 1) CuPy (CUDA): Please select the distribution that matches your CUDA, uncomment one of them
# cupy-cuda11x>=12.0        # For CUDA 11.x
# cupy-cuda12x>=13.0        # For CUDA 12.x

JAX
# CPU version (default general, convenient for running directly in environments without CUDA)
jax>=0.4.20
If you need CUDA, please install the jaxlib wheel that matches CUDA according to the official JAX instructions (example, replace the version and cuda/cudnn tags as needed):
# jaxlib==0.4.31+cuda12.cudnn89  --find-links https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

# Note: Both can be installed; the GPU will be automatically prioritized during runtime (JAX > CuPy > NumPy fallback).

# —— Other (optional) ——
# seaborn           # If additional visualization beautification is needed
